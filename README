This package contains a fix rhok command that calculate the Fourier Transform
of the density and apply the biasing potential to control centain wave vectors.

In order to install this package, make a directory 'USR-RHOK' under 'src' folder.
Move files 'fix_rhok.cpp', 'fix_rhok.h' and 'Install.sh' into 'src/USR-RHOK/'
Then from the src directory, this is as simple as:
	make yes-user-rhok
	make mpi

Currently, the package has the following features:

* Compute the certain wave vector of the Fourier Transform Density in x, y or z direction,
  and output the real and imaginary components.

* Apply the pariabolic biasing potential to control the real or imaginary components of 
  a certain wave vector.

There are example scripts for using this package in Github.
