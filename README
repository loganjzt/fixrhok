This package contains a fix rhok command that calculate the Fourier Transform
of the density and apply the biasing potential to control centain wave vectors.

Currently, the package has the following features:

* Compute the certain wave vector of the Fourier Transform Density in x, y or z direction,
  and output the real and imaginary components.

* Apply the pariabolic biasing potential to control the real or imaginary components of 
  a certain wave vector.

There are example scripts for using this package in Github.

The person who created this package is Zhitong Jiang (zhitongj@seas.upenn.edu)
in Amish Patel's Group (pamish@seas.upenn.edu).  Contact them directly
if you have questions.
